    "\n",
    "- Why is the shape [1, time_frames, 768]?  \n",
    "    This shape represents a 3D Tensor, which is standard for sequence modeling. Each dimension has a specific meaning:\n",
    "    - `1` (Batch Size): This represents the number of audio samples you processed at once. Since you passed a single waveform, the batch size is 1.\n",
    "    - `time_frames` (Sequence Length): Audio is a continuous signal. Wav2Vec2 divides the audio into small, overlapping windows (frames).\n",
    "        - For Wav2Vec2, the CNN encoder typically produces one feature vector for every 20ms of audio.\n",
    "        - If your audio is 1 second long, you will have roughly 50 time frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `768` (Embedding Dimension/Hidden Size): This is the \"depth\" of the model. For the Wav2Vec2-Base architecture, every single time frame is represented by a vector of 768 numbers. These numbers capture the phonetic and acoustic characteristics of that specific slice of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why does Mean Pooling \"remove\" the time_frames?  \n",
    "    Mean pooling is a mathematical reduction. When you call torch.mean(feats, dim=1), you are telling PyTorch to collapse the second dimension (the time axis) by calculating the average.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Mathematics  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    If your `feats` tensor is visualized as a matrix for each batch:  \n",

    "    $X = [f_1, f_2, f_3, \\ldots, f_T]$  \n",

    "    Where each $f_t​$ is a vector of size 768, mean pooling performs:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    $\\text{Embedding} = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} f_t$  \n",
    "\n",
    "    The Result:  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Input: 100 different vectors (one for each moment in time).\n",
    "    - Output: 1 single vector (the \"average\" of all those moments).\n",
    "\n",
    "    The dimension dim=1 disappears because it has been aggregated. You move from a \"sequence of features\" to a \"single global feature\" that represents the entire audio clip."
